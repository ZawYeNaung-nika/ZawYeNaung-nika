Copper,Type:Mineral-native elements,Chemical Symbol: Cu,Hardness : 2.5 to 3,Specific Gravity : 8.9,Cleavage : None,"Fracture : Hackly,ductile",Streak : Rose,Luster : Metallic,"Note : In its free-occurring metallic state, copper  was probably the first metal to be used by humans. Neolithic people are believed to have used copper as a substitute for stone by 8000 BCE. Around 4000 BCE, Egyptians cast copper in molds. By 3500 BCE, copper began to be alloyed with tin to produce bronze.Copper is opaque, bright, and metallic salmon pink on freshly broken surfaces but soon turns dull brown. Copper crystals are uncommon, but when formed are either cubic or dodecahedral, often arranged in branching aggregates.  Most copper is found as irregular, flattened, or branching masses. It is one of the few metals that occur in the “native” form without being bonded to other elements. Native copper seems to be a secondary mineral, a result of interaction between copper-bearing solutions and iron-bearing minerals"
Platinum,Type:Mineral-native elements,Chemical Symbol: Pt,Hardness : 4 to 4.5,Specific Gravity : 14 to 19,Cleavage : None,Fracture : Hackly,Streak : Whitish steel-gray,Luster : Metallic,"Note :The first documented discovery of platinum was by the Spaniards in the 1500s, in the alluvial gold mines of the Río Pinto, Colombia. They called it platina del Pinto, from platina, which means “little silver,” thinking that it was an impure ore of silver. It was not recognized as a distinct metal until 1735. It is opaque, silvery gray, and markedly dense. Platinum usually occurs as disseminated grains in ironand magnesium-rich igneous rocks and in quartz veins associated with hematite, chlorite, and pyrolusite . When rocks weather, the heavy platinum accumulates as grains and nuggets in the resulting placer deposits. Crystals are rare, but when found they are cubic. Most platinum for commercial use is recovered from primary deposits. Native platinum typically contains iron and metals such as palladium, 
iridium, and rhodium"
Iron,Type:Mineral-native elements,"Chemical Symbol: Fe,Ni",Hardness : 4,Specific Gravity : 7.3 to 7.9,Cleavage : None,Fracture : Hackly,Streak : Steel-gray,Luster : Metallic,"Note : Five percent of Earth’s crust is made up of iron. Native iron is rare in the crust and is invariably alloyed with nickel. Low-nickel iron (up to 7.5 percent nickel) is called kamacite, and high-nickel iron (up to 50 percent nickel) is called taenite. Both crystallize in the cubic system. A third form of iron-nickel, mainly found in meteorites and crystallizing in the tetragonal system, is called tetrataenite. All three forms are generally found either as disseminated grains or as rounded masses. 
Kamacite is the major component of most iron meteorites (p.335). It is found in most chondritic meteorites, and occurs as microscopic grains in some 
lunar rocks. Taenite and tetrataenite are mainly found in meteorites, often intergrown with kamacite. Iron is also plentiful in the Sun and other stars"
Bismuth,Type:Mineral-native elements,Chemical Symbol: Bi,Hardness :2 to 2.5,Specific Gravity : 9.7 to 9.8,Cleavage : Perfect Basal,Fracture : Uneven,Streak : Silver-white,Luster : Metallic,"Note : As a native metal, bismuth has been known since the Middle Ages. A German monk named Basil Valentine first described it in 1450. Bismuth is often found uncombined with other elements, forming indistinct crystals, often in parallel groupings. It is hard, brittle, and lustrous. It is also found in grains and as foliated masses. Silver-white, it usually has a reddish tinge that distinguishes it. Specimens may have an iridescent tarnish. Bismuth is found in hydrothermal veins and in pegmatites (p.260) and is often associated with ores of tin, lead, or copper , from which it is separated as a by-product. Bismuth expands slightly when it 
solidifies, making its alloys useful in the manufacture of metal castings with sharp detailing. Bismuth salts are often used as soothing agents for digestive disorders"
Antimony,Type:Mineral-native elements,Chemical Symbol: Sb,Hardness : 3 to 3.5 ,Specific Gravity : 6.6 to 6.7,Cleavage : Perfect Basal,Fracture : Uneven,Streak : Gray,Luster : Metallic,"Note : Although recognized as a metal since the 8th century or earlier, antimony was only identified as an element in 1748. Crystals are rare but when found are either 
psuedocubic or thick and tabular. Antimony usually occurs in massive, foliated, or granular form. It is lustrous, silvery, bluish white in color, and has a flaky texture that makes it brittle. It almost always contains some arsenic and is found in veins with silver, arsenic , and other antimony minerals. Antimony is extremely important in alloys. Even in minor quantities, it imparts strength and hardness to other metals, particularly lead, whose alloys are used in the plates of automobile storage batteries, in bullets, and in coverings for cables. Combined with tin and lead, antimony forms antifriction alloys called babbitt metals, which are used as components of machine bearings. Like bismuth, antimony expands slightly on solidifying, making it a useful alloying metal for detailed castings"
Gold,Type:Mineral-native elements,Chemical Symbol: Au,Hardness : 2.5 to 3,Specific Gravity : 19.3,Cleavage : None,Fracture : Hackly,Streak : Golden yellow,Luster : Metallic,"Note : Throughout human history, gold has been the most prized metal. It is opaque, has a highly attractive metallic golden yellow color, is extremely malleable, and is usually found in a relatively pure form. It is remarkably inert, so it resists tarnish. These qualities have made it exceptionally valuable. Gold usually occurs as treelike growths, grains, and scaly masses. It rarely occurs as well-formed crystals, but when found these are octahedral or dodecahedral. Gold is mostly found in hydrothermal veins with quartz and sulfides. Virtually all granitic igneous rocks—in which it occurs as invisible, disseminated grains—contain low concentrations of gold. Almost all of the gold recovered since antiquity has come from placer deposits—weathered gold particles concentrated in river and stream gravel."
Silver,Type:Mineral-native elements,Chemical Symbol: Ag,Hardness : 2.5 to 3,Specific Gravity : 10.1 to 11.1,Cleavage : None,Fracture : Hackly,Streak : Silver-white,Luster : Metallic,"Note :The earliest silver ornaments and decorations were found in tombs that date as far back as 4000 BCE. Silver coinage began to appear around 550 BCE. Opaque and bright silvery white with a slightly pink tint, silver readily tarnishes to either gray or black. Natural crystals of silver are uncommon, but when found they are cubic, octahedral, or dodecahedral. Silver is usually found in granular habit and as wiry, branching, lamellar, or scaly masses.Widely distributed in nature, silver 
is a primary hydrothermal mineral. It also forms by alteration of other silver-bearing minerals. Much of the world’s silver production is a by-product of refining lead, copper, and zinc. Silver is the second most malleable and ductile metal, and it is important in the photographic and electronic industries."
